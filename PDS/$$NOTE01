Hi Sam,

I saw your post on IBM-MAIN about the TASID zap.

I worked out a fix on the 2.4 system in my TASIDX.LOAD library.

I just copied TASID from SYS1.CBT.LINKLIB to TASIDX.LOAD and
zapped the copy.

Apparently is has another zap applied besides the one in File
980, related to panels, so I couldn't use an unmodified TASID
without knowing what that other zap is.

The simplest fix is to change just this one line:

REP 8A A74801B8

to this:

REP 8A A74801D8

It should then work on V2R4 but not on V2R2 or V2R3

The 01D8 is the offset of CCTPIT into the HCCT DSECT in
SYS1.SHASMAC($HCCT) and apparently it sometimes changes from
release to release.

The VER statement in file 980:
  VER 82 911024F5
is this instruction:
  TM CVTOSLV5,CVTZOS_V1R9
which tests for v1r9 or higher

The REP statement in File 980 replaces it with this:
  REP 82 914024F6
which is this instruction:
  TM CVTOSLV6,CVTZOS_V2R2
which tests for v2r2 or higher

This could be changed to this:
  REP 82 910824F6
which is this instruction:
  TM CVTOSLV6,CVTZOS_V2R4
which tests for v2r4 or higher

but it's not necessary unless you want it to work on v2r2 and
v2r3 systems too as well as v2r4.

In that case I think you would also have to change this
  REP 92 A74801B0
to this:
  REP 92 A74801B8

but I can't test it because I only have the v2r4 system to test
with.  That 01B0 and 01B8 are the CCTPIT-HCCT offset to be used
if the TM is not true.  (Now tested on 2.2 and 2.3 and it works.)

The logic in the file 980 is "use offset 01b8 if true (v2r2),
else use offset 01b0.

That could be changed to "use offset 01D8 if true (v2r4) else use
01b8 (v2r2 v2r3).

Best wishes.
