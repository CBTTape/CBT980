Hi Sam,

I have another zap to TASID. When there are active jobs, the
initiator display does not show the job class for active jobs in
the far right column.

After the zap, the first character of the 8-character job class
will be shown. I think 8-character job classes were introduced
with v2r1.

The control block it gets the class from is in SYS1.SHASMAC($SJB)
and the 8-byte class is in the label SJBJOBCL. The class used to
be in a 1-byte area following SJBSTACA, which is now an unnamed
1-byte area.

  NAME   TASID TASIDINT
  VER 0374 D200,A192,2118
  REP 0374 D200,A192,2150

Best wishes.
